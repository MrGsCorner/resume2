            <hr>
             <p>My wife and I celebrated our 30th anniversary on August 15, 2022. We have two daughters (a 26-year-old & 18-year-old).
                Four dogs named Buster Brown, Ellie Mae, Izzy Pop, and Motley Crue, and three cats named Circuit, Bella, 
                and Orange Kitty, 19 years old. We also welcomed a grandson into the family on August 29, 2020! He will be two years old soon.

                <h3>Experience:</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>I am working towards my 7th year of teaching at Magnet Cove Elementary.  I am currently teaching literacy, math, science, 
                   and social studies. I spent a year at Drew Central as a student-teacher. After graduating from UAM, I went to work for 
                   Eastside Elementary in Warren, AR. This is my seventh year at Magnet Cove, and I look forward to many more! I have also 
                   completed my Master’s of Science in Reading in Education. I am now working towards getting CALT certification and licensure
                   in Arkansas for “Online Teaching, Grades K-12”.</p> 
                <h3>Future Educational Goals</h3>
                <p>As mentioned before, I am working towards my K -12 Online Teaching Certification. I may decide to pursue that Master's Certification
                   once I have completed the 15 hours my scholarship provides. However, I plan on pursuing my EDs in Reading at some point soon.
